/*This program mimics an online shopping cart.  
You are the proprietor of an online shop and 
have to keep track of inventory, price and the
userâ€™s shopping cart.  Create a menu of at least 
10 items for the user to choose from.  Identify 
your starting inventory and price.  As the user 
an item, you should remove that item from inventory 
(subtract 1) and add the price to a total.  When the
user is done adding items to their cart, you should 
output a statement of what they have ordered and the 
total cost of their purchases.  Do not allow you 
inventory to go below 0.*/
